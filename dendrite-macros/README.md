# Crate dendrite-macros

The registration of command / event / query handlers using the [dendrite crate](https://crates.io/crates/dendrite) requires some non-obvious syntax. These macros accept definitions that are easy to explain and remember and produce the code that is necessary to make dendrite happy.

Status: usable.
